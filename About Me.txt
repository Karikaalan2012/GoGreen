Hi! My name is Joshua. I know I might be the youngest one here today, but I've been coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a few years now. Even though I'm still learning, I can already build websites that look cool and work smoothly. I love that code lets me take my ideas and turn them into something real, something people can interact with. It's like having a superpower for creativity!
